In the following, we verify that a non-faithful representation of SL_4 is virtually free for sl_4

Testing A3 in char 2 expecting generically free for a sum of 4 copies of irrep with highest wt [ 0, 1, 0 ]
    ... Lie algebra is for the simply connected group
    ... Constructed 4 copies of a representation of dimension 6
    ... Kernel of the action has dimension 1
    ---> Putative generic stabilizer has dimension 1, not the predicted 0
    Representation is VIRTUALLY free
true
